# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer: Object-oriented programing is to make coding more efficient due to the complexity and size of the code. It is different from functional programming by having everything an object.

Researched answer: Object-oriented programing is based on the concept of objects and it was created to deal with complexity of large software systems. Organizing code for maximum reusability, OOP structures a program by bundling related properties and behaviors into invidividual objects. Functional programming uses immutable data to tell the program what to do, while OOP tells the program how to achieve results through objects altering the programs state.

2. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

Your answer: The difference between Float and an integer is that a Float has an remainder or a decimal and a Integer is a whole number.

Researched answer: Both are number types. Floats are numbers that contain a decimal point, while integers are whole numbers.

3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: In ruby implicit return will return the last line of code within the block.

Researched answer: In Ruby, implicit return means if there is not a return specified then the value of the last line of a method is returned. 

4. What is a block in Ruby?

Your answer: A block in ruby is a block of code within a method. 

Researched answer: Is an anonymous funciton that is passed to a method to determine the outcome. Blocks typically have the Ruby keywords do and end.

5. How do you extract a single value from a Ruby hash?

Your answer: To extract a single value from a Ruby hash, you need to use square brackets with the symbol of the value you are trying to get.

Researched answer: To extract a single value from a Ruby hash, you will need to call upon the hash, then within the brackets call upon the key that is associated with the value you want to extract. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. RSpec: Rspec is a unit test framework used to describe the behavior of objects within Ruby. Used to create specifications that describe the desired output. It may be the same as jest testing in javascript.

2. Test-driven development: A process that relying on a software requirement being converted to test cases before software is fully developed i.e developers write code first before writing the actual code to maintain the overall code quality.

3. PostgreSQL: PostgreSQL is a object-relational database management system. It is an open source relational database system that supports querying.

4. CRUD: Actions checklist decscribing complete data manipulation of; Create, Read, Update, Delete. Implement for storeage applications.

5. HTTP: HTTP is Hypertext Transfer Protocol, and is the set of rules for transferring files over the web.
